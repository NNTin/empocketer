<p>Empocketer is in 'alpha' - there are lots of missing features, and almost certainly a bunch of bugs. Below is a non-exhaustive list of features to be added.</p>

<ul>
	<li>add ability to see all lists that subscribe to a particular site</li>
	<li>add ability to set lists as 'public' so other users can subscribe</li>
	<li>add ability to delete account (will need to remove user id from all subscriptions, QUESTION: what happens to lists the user created that are subscribed to by other people?)</li>
	<li>better error handling and UI tips for adding URLs</li>
	<li>Create lists via OPML upload</li>
	<li>general styling and design improvements</li>
	<li>add ability to manually add feeds if auto-detection doesn't work</li>
	<li><del>fix responsiveness</del> (basic done, needs more work)</li>
	<li><del>note to tell user to click on listname to go to list</del></li>
	<li><del>UI indicator that user is logged in (username with logout option at top?)</del></li>
